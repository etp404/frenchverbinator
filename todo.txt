No need for OptionsCheckBox. I assume this had some purpose earlier on, but there's no obvious need for it now.
Settings view shouldn't know baout presenter. Should be able to list for adding or removal of tenses.
I'd like to get rid of 'Build.VERSION.SDK_INT' from QuestionView.
Animates when closing app from settings view, which seems a bit odd.
Could put the parsing stuff on the application and pull in the service from there. Otherwise there's work done in QuestionActivity every time it's created.
